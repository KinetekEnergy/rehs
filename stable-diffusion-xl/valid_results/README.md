The original results folders that MLCFlow produced had a file that was several
dozen GB that I deleted to save space. I unfortunately don't have the original
results folders anymore, only the results folders minus that one very large
file (which you can find here). I don't know if MLCommons will allow these
results as-is to be a valid submission, so you may have to rerun the scripts.
